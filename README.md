This is a simple Dev Resource that will allow you to pull the amount of people online for any job on the server without any ServerCallBack.

This version also gives option for checking job numbers server side instead of client side only.

if GlobalState.jobnumbers['police'] > 0 then

  this code will only run if atleast 1 person on the server
  is set as a police

end
